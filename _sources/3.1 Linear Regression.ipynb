    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear Regression is a machine learning algorithm based on supervised learning. It performs a regression task i.e to predict a continous value. Linear regression attempts to model the relationship between two variables by **fitting a linear equation to observed data**. One variable is considered to be an explanatory variable, and the other is considered to be a dependent variable. For example, a modeler might want to relate the weights of individuals to their heights using a linear regression model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression models a value based target prediction on independent variables. It is mostly used for finding out the relationship between variables and forecasting. Different regression models differ based on – the kind of relationship between dependent and independent variables, they are considering and the number of independent variables being used.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Simple Linear Regression\n",
    "In This Section we will discuss **Simple Linear Regression**.\n",
    "Simple linear regression is a type of regression analysis where the number of independent variables is one and there is a linear relationship between the independent(x) and dependent(y) variable."

    "Linear regression performs the task to predict a dependent variable value (y) based on a given independent variable (x). So, this regression technique finds out a **linear relationship** between x (input) and y(output) and variation in predicted value from actual answer is due to random noise . Hence, the name is Linear Regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple linear regression is used to find out the best relationship between a single input variable (predictor, independent variable, input feature, input parameter) & output variable (predicted, dependent variable, output feature, output parameter) provided that both variables are continuous in nature. This relationship represents how an input variable is related to the output variable and how it is represented by a straight line.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand this concept, let us have a look at scatter plots. Scatter diagrams or plots provides a graphical representation of the relationship of two continuous variables."

    "The idea behind r2 score is to compare the model with the mean model which is let's assume you are given some data and asked to predict the answer for some unseen data your most safe bid will we to calculate the mean and give that as the answer this is the most basic method with which you can answer.\n",

    "Generally, the Range of r2 score lies between `0-1` as if our model's error is equal to mean model error value of r2 score will be zero if our model is so bad that it's error is even greater than that of mean model value of r2 score will be negative and when our model error will be zero it will have the highest value of 1\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Linearity:** The relationship between X and the mean of Y is linear.\n",

    "3. **Independence:** Observations are independent of each other.\n",

    "### Overfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "Overfitting is a concept in data science and machine learning, which occurs when a statistical model fits exactly against its training data. When this happens, the algorithm unfortunately cannot perform accurately against unseen data, defeating its purpose. Generalization of a model to new data is ultimately what allows us to use machine learning algorithms every day to make predictions and classify data.\n",
    "\n",
    "When machine learning algorithms are constructed, they leverage a sample dataset to train the model. However, when the model trains for too long on sample data or when the model is too complex, it can start to learn the “noise,” or irrelevant information, within the dataset. When the model memorizes the noise and fits too closely to the training set, the model becomes “overfitted,” and it is unable to generalize well to new data. If a model cannot generalize well to new data, then it will not be able to perform the classification or prediction tasks that it was intended for.\n",
    "\n",
    "Low error rates and a high variance are good indicators of overfitting. In order to prevent this type of behavior, part of the training dataset is typically set aside as the “test set” to check for overfitting. If the training data has a low error rate and the test data has a high error rate, it signals overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Underfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "Underfitting is a scenario in data science and machine learning where a data model is unable to capture the relationship between the input and output variables accurately, generating a high error rate on both the training set and unseen data. It occurs when a model is too simple, which can be a result of a model needing more training time, more input features, or less regularization. Like overfitting, when a model is underfitted, it cannot establish the dominant trend within the data, resulting in training errors and poor performance of the model. If a model cannot generalize well to new data, then it cannot be leveraged for classification or prediction tasks. Generalization of a model to new data is ultimately what allows us to use machine learning algorithms every day to make predictions and classify data.\n",
    "\n",
    "High bias and low variance are good indicators of underfitting. Since this behavior can be seen while using the training dataset, underfitted models are usually easier to identify than overfitted ones.\n"

    "**A overfitted model will give low error in case of training data but comparatively high error on testing(validation) data**\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a connection between these two, as to prevent underfitting you will want your model to be flexible enough to take on irregular distribution of data but that increases the chances of overfitting of the model, thus it is neccessary to stop at an optimal complexity for the model.\n",
