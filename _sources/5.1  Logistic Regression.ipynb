    "Logistic Regression is used when the dependent variable(target) is categorical and the independent variables are continuous.\n",

    "In logistic regression we try to make a **decision boundary** seprating the two classes. In case where there is two features a line will be representing the decision boundary. And for increase in the dimension of data, decision boundary's dimension will also increase. following diagram helpls us to visualize the following-"
