    "## Introduction to Multi-nomial Naive Bayes\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw in Naive Bayes, it is a simple technique for constructing binary classifiers: models that are able to classify in binary values(0 & 1). A naive Bayes classifier considers each of these features to contribute independently. A Multinomial Naive Bayes is able to perform a lot of complexer tasks. Like Naive Bayes was able to classify an email into the category of Spam or Not Spam, but if we want to classify some articles into some categories, naive Bayes may not be able to do it, as it is not a binary classification task. But on the other hand, Multinomial Naive Bayes is able to perform this task.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm is a probabilistic learning method that is mostly used in Natural Language Processing (NLP). The algorithm is based on the Bayes theorem and predicts the tag of a text such as a piece of email or newspaper article. It calculates the probability of each tag for a given sample and then gives the tag with the highest probability as output. Let's try to understand Multinomial naive Bayes with the help of an example.  \n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Classify these articles in the sector of Education, News or Sports:\n",
    "1. The Prime Minister of India, changed their currency notes.\n",
    "2. Virat Kohli is a great young player of Cricket. He is one of the great batsman of India.\n",
    "3. Vivekanand International is a great school. There are many co-curricular activities also.\n",
    "4. Internet Services has been banned in Jammu. Will be resumed by next month.\n",
    "5. Students of D.A.V are very active. Cricket is very popular among them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now just by looking at the existence of some words, we will not be able to classify them correctly. As we can see, \"India\" is present on both article no. $1$ and $2$. But the $1^{st}$ article should be classified under `News` while $2^{nd}$ should be classified under `Sports`. Same as article no. $2$ and $5$, both have the word \"Cricket\". But $2^{nd}$ is under `Sports` and $5^{th}$ is under `Education`. So, we need something more robust here, so we can classify them by also seeing the word count. So the vectorization in Multinomial Naive Bayes is performed by filling out the word count, instead of 0 and 1."
