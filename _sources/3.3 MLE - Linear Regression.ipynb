    "\n",
    "Previously in linear regression section for calculating the optimal values of parameters of best fit line we defined a loss function. which we were minimising in order to find values of parameters. But we took that loss function intuitively and solved the equation and came up with right values of parameters.In this section we will try to find the loss function that can be used to find  optimal values of parameters by a method called **Maximum Likelihood Estimation**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "In statistics, **Maximum likelihood estimation** (MLE) is a method of estimating the parameters of a probability distribution by maximizing a likelihood function, so that under the assumed statistical model the observed data is most probable.  \n",
    "Maximum likelihood estimation is a method that determines values for the parameters of a model. The parameter values are found such that they maximise the likelihood that the process described by the model produced the data that were actually observed.\n",

    "For better and deep understanding you can refer to following - https://shorturl.at/msFI3\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically we try to find out value of parameters for which likelihood(probability) of that data will be maximum Here we will use this method for Linear Regression.We first required to understand what a probability distribution is.\n",

    "## Probabilty Distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "In probability theory and statistics, a probability distribution is the mathematical function that gives the probabilities of occurrence of different possible outcomes for an experiment. It is a mathematical description of a random phenomenon in terms of its sample space and the probabilities of events (subsets of the sample space).\n",

    "\n",
    "There are many other types of distribution too Here we will use normal distribution.In linear regression we assumed that there is **Homoscedasticity** which mean that The variance of residual is the same for any value of X. mean Error is random of every given data and is independent.Thus we can assume that the **Error is from a normal distribution**.\n",

    "### Normal Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "Normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution, is a probability distribution that is symmetric about the mean, showing that data near the mean are more frequent in occurrence than data far from the mean. In graph form, normal distribution will appear as a bell curve.\n",

    "Asuming for a given fixed data say $X_i$ we can say that prediction is will be a constant (fixed value) as our model parameters reamain fixed and give same output for same data in a model. For the equation ${Y_{true}{i}=Y_{pred}{i}+ e{i}}$ as $Y_{pred}{i}$ is constant and for a given data and $e_i$ belongs to a standard normal distribution from given information and equation we can conclude that $Y_{true}{i}$ **will also belong to a Normal distribution**\n",
    "\n",
    "As for given data say $X_i$, $Y_{pred}{i}$ is constant sum of it with $e_i$ which belongs to a standard normal distribution will result in a normally distributed data but **every value will get incresed by** $Y_{pred}{i}$ but resultant distribution will be a Normal distribution.Therfore, for $Y_{pred}{i}$'s distribution mean will be $\\large e_i$'s mean + $Y_{pred}{i}$ which is equals to $Y_{pred}{i}$.As every value is getting scaled The standard deviation( $\\large \\sigma$) will remain the same.\n",
