    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Now as we saw in **Linear Regression** (Univariate Regression), we had **only one independent feature** or we can say we had only one explanatory variable, for our dependent variable.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "In our house prediction dataset, we took only a single feature of **Land Size** and our house price was dependent on that, but talking about real life, we know that land size isn't the only factor which affects the house price. There are a lot of other factors like: _locality, no. of floors, society, hospitals availabily, water, electricity, hygiene, parking space_, and there are a lot of other factors too that affect the house price. For that we will need something that can handle multiple features.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "This is where Multi-Variable Regression comes in place. In Multi-variable Regression, we train our model by using **more than one feature**. In that case we'll need **multiple values of m & c**, as we know every feature scales the price differently. So as every feature scales price differently, we can assign different weights to different features of X.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "So now instead of predicting the values with the help of $mx + c$, we have to use the equation:  \n",
    "\n",
    "> $y_{pred} = m_1x_1 + m_2x_2 + m_3x_3 + m_4x_4 + m_5x_5 + ..... m_nx_n + c$ (where n = no. of features)  \n",
    "  \n",
    "and as we're defining these $m$ as weights, we will start calling them $w$ instead. So now I can write my equation as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$y_{pred} = w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + w_3x_3 + w_4x_4 + w_5x_5 + ..... w_nx_n + w_0$ (where n = no. of features)  \n",
    "\n",
    "$y_{pred} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_ix_i + w_0$  \n",
    "\n",
    "$y_{pred} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_ix_i + w_0x_0 \\hspace{1.5cm}$ [$x_0 = 1$]  \n",
    "\n",
    "$y_{pred} = \\sum_{i=0}^{n} w_ix_i$  \n",

    "Currently, here we took a very small amount of points i.e. 100, and had only 3 features, but in real-life datasets, we have a lot more instances and features than this, which will require a lot of memory usage (mainly RAM usage), and in most of the cases our system RAM is not enough to load the entire dataset at once, and as it involves a lot of vector multiplication and inverse calculation, it is very computationally heavy and memory inefficient.  \n",
    "So to overcome this limitation, we use an optimization technique like Gradient Descent, which we'll see in a later module."
