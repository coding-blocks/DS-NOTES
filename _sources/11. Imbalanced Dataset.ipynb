    "Let's consider a case where we have to do a classification task between two classes, say we have to classify between 2 classes: \"A\" & \"B\", and \"A\" has a lot more instances than \"B\". Then a very worse model can give a very good accuracy score here.  \n",

So our dataset will have a lot more instances of *not having cancer* as compared to *having cancer*. Talking in figures, let's say we have a dataset in which class \"A\"(not having cancer) has 2500 instances, and class \"B\"(having cancer) has only 50 instances. So, even though we train a worst model that classifies everything as \"A\" will have a very high accuracy.  \n",

    "One way of the easiest way of balancing dataset can be randomly sampling from the classes having higher instances, and make no. of instances of each class equal. This way all the classes will have equal no. of datasets, but by doing this we'll suffer through a lot of information loss. A lot of variability among the data will be lost, so this can't be a good approach.\n",

    "### Double the existing instances:\n",
    "\n",
    "Another approach can be to double up the existing minority class instances, which seems to be a good option as it doesn't include any information loss. But here also we're just assigning doubling the weights of the existing datapoints of minor class, which will not provide us any new information. So even if we didn't lose any information, we still didn't got any new information.\n",
